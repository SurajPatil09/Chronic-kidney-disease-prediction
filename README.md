# Chronic-kidney-disease-prediction
In my prediction model,I have used artificial neural networks to analyze the data set collected from the UCI Repository. A filtered dataset of 400 people with six CKD-related attributes from a total of 25 attributes is used.

From the results analysis, it is observed that the Artificial Neural Network can result accuracy 100% . The advantage of this system is that the prediction process is less time-consuming. It will help the doctors to start the treatments early for the CKD patients, and it will also help to diagnose more patients within a less time period. To build a machine learning model targeting chronic kidney disease with an overall accuracy of 99.99%.
