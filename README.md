# Chronic-kidney-disease-prediction
In my prediction model,I have used artificial neural networks to analyze the data set collected from the UCI Repository. A filtered dataset of 400 people with six CKD-related attributes from a total of 25 attributes is used.
I have analyzed some attributes related to CKD patients and predicted the accuracy of the model. From the results analysis, it is observed that the Artificial Neural Network can result accuracy 100% . The advantage of this system is that the prediction process is less time-consuming. It will help the doctors to start the treatments early for the CKD patients, and it will also help to diagnose more patients within a less time period. To build a machine learning model targeting chronic kidney disease with an overall accuracy of 99.99%, will need millions of records with zero missing values.
